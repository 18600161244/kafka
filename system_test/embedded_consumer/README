This test replicates messages from one kafka node to another using the embedded consumer. At the end, the messages 
produced at the source kafka node should be identical to that at the target kafka node.

To run this test, do
bin/run-test.sh

The expected output is given in expected.out. There are 2 things to pay attention to:
1. The output should have a line "test passed".
2. The throughput from the producer should be around 90,000 Messages/sec on a typical machine.

This test may take 10 to 15 minutes to finish.
